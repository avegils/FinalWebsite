The last monarch of Hawaii, Queen Lili’uokalani, was overthrown in 1893, and Harrison actually sent a bill to the Senate to approve the annexation, but Grover Cleveland became president before it was passed, and he withdrew the bill.</p>

In January 1918, Wilson advocated for men and women to have an equal voice in elections, and would later make written and verbal arguments to members of Congress. His lobbying undoubtedly helped states ratify the 19th Amendment in August 1920, finally granting women the right to cast their ballot.</p>

Truman ordered for the rodents to be shot, but the groundskeepers instead began to shoo them away.</p>
